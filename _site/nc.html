The function of a challenge is laid out in [<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-168-727.pdf">168.727</a>] and [<a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(xxxpylaxkgoivllasuezl5ca))/mileg.aspx?page=GetMCLDocument&amp;objectname=mcl-168-733">168.733</a>]. The law concerning poll watchers is posted prominently on the North Carolina website but does not seem to be supported by statute; they are discussed in a guidebook <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2020/04-20-MI-SAC-Report-Voting-Rights.pdf">guidebook</a> issued by the North Carolina advisory committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. - Anyone can be a poll watcher, and can decide to do so the day of the election. Poll watchers can stand in the public area of a precinct and watch the election. They can also watch an absent voting board - although then they must stay in the room until the polls close at 8, and also may not divulge any information about the vote count until the polls close at 8. Election challengers be appointed by any organized group interested in vote transparency or any any incorporated organization whatsoever between 20-30 days before election day. Challengers are guaranteed a closer look at what’s happening and may view the pollbook and the voting machines (optional for poll watchers). Neither may interact with voters in their capacity as a challenger/watcher. - <strong>Rules for poll watchers</strong> - Poll watchers do not have to be registered to vote. - They must follow the same conduct standards as challengers (see below) - They cannot challenge a person’s right to vote or the actions of the precinct board. - Poll watchers may look at the Poll Book at the precinct board chairperson’s discretion, while challengers may always do so. - Poll watchers and challengers watching absentee voting must stay until close of the polls (8 pm) and swear the same oath. - Poll watchers may not sit behind the processing table; they must sit or stand in the public area of the polling place where they will not interfere with the process. - Poll watchers can not record in the polling place but can take notes and use cell phones. (<a href="https://www.North Carolina.gov/documents/SOS_ED_2_CHALLENGERS_77017_7.pdf">The Appointment, Rights and Duties of Election Challengers and Poll Watches</a>)</p> <p>These rights are are outlined in:</p> <p>- - - <a href="https://www.North Carolina.gov/documents/sos/XI_Election_Day_Issues_266009_7.pdf">Election Official’s Manual</a> - Issued by the North Carolina Bureau of Elections - <a href="https://www.North Carolina.gov/documents/SOS_ED_2_CHALLENGERS_77017_7.pdf">The Appointment, Rights and Duties of Election Challengers and Poll Watches</a> - issued by North Carolina Bureau of Elections in September 2020. - These are legally binding by statute. - <strong>Rules for election challengers</strong> - Election challengers can be appointed by a political party, incorporated organization (presumably including a newspaper), an organized group of citizens regarding a ballot proposal or a group of citizens organized for election integrity. - The challenger application must be filed between 20-30 days before the election. No more than 30 or less than 20. - Election challengers can observe the election process in voting precincts and absent voter counting board precincts and challenge the actions of the election inspectors serving in the precinct of the challenger believes the election law is not being followed. - Challengers must be registered voters in North Carolina. Any organization can only have two challengers per precinct and one per absent voter counting board at any time during the day (there could be shifts). - Challengers in an absent voter counting board must stay there all day and take an oath not to reveal anything until they counting is over; those at precincts may rotate.

Otherwise it looks like it’s just a regular ballot. - On or before 8 a.m. on election day, the clerk shall post the number of absent voter ballots distributed to absent voters and the number of absent voter ballot return envelopes received. On or before 9 p.m. they shall post the number of absent voter ballot return envelopes containing the marked ballots of absent voters received by the clerk on election day and delivered to the board of election inspectors, along with the total number of absent voter ballot return envelopes containing the marked ballots of absent voters received by the clerk both before and on election day and delivered to the board of election inspectors or the absent voter counting boards. As soon as possible after all precincts in the city or township are processed, the clerk shall post in the clerk’s office or otherwise make public the number of absent voter ballot return envelopes containing the marked ballots of absent voters received by the election inspectors at the precincts on election day, along with the total number of absent voter ballot return envelopes containing the marked ballots of absent voters received in the city or township for that election.
